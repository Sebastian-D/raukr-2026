This workshop is aimed at both Ph.D. students and researchers within life sciences who are already using R for bioinformatics data analyses and who would like to start using R at a more advanced level.

The workshop takes place in the city of Visby nestled on the island of Gotland, Sweden. This medieval town, dating back to the 12th century, is a UNESCO world heritage site.

## Venue

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| output: asis

dfr <- dfr %>%
  mutate(address = paste0("<a target='_blank' href='", url, "'>", label, "</a>,", address)) %>%

The workshop is held on [Campus Gotland](http://www.campusgotland.uu.se/), Uppsala University. Here is the full address:

::: {.large}

[B27 Lärosal](https://link.mazemap.com/q9F307rf)  
Campus Gotland  
Uppsala University  
Cramérgatan 3  
621 57 Visby  
Gotland, Sweden  

:::

::: {.callout-note}
The classroom windows may be left open in case the room gets warm. If you are easily disturbed by external noise, it might a good idea to bring noise cancelling headphones for practical labs (we are close to Visby harbor). If it's a wet summer, it might be cold in the classroom, so it's good to carry couple of pieces of warm clothing.
